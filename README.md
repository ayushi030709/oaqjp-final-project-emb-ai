 this repository contains my emotion detector project that is basically inspired from sentiment analysis .
It predicts the emotions and make the analysis which is very useful in buisness or online reeviews.
So go through my code and you will see the steps involved as
- Clone the project repository
- Make the application of emotion detector
- format the application so that it returns dictionary values
- deploy the application using flask
- incorporate error handlers
- use pep guidelines for refining the codes
